    Bit House Saloon
    One of Bit House's main strengths is the sheer variety of drinks it offers. 
    Interested in creative cocktails? The Southeast Portland bar has you covered 
    with classics made right, thoughtful original drinks, and a list of Old 
    Fashioneds. More of a whiskey gal? Bit House's selection is comparable to 
    that of a dedicated whiskey bar. Looking to sample Portland's highly praised 
    beer scene? There are plenty of brews on tap. Perhaps a little surprisingly, 
    the heavily-wooded, pre-Prohibition era space is also rumored to be the 
    origin of "frosé;" even if that's not quite the case, it was certainly one 
    of the first to mix rosé and spirits and serve the slushy mixture.

    Multnomah Whiskey Library
    At Multnomah Whiskey Library, there are cocktails, to be sure, most of 
    which are whiskey-based. There's even beer and wine. But to order those 
    would be a bewildering choice. MWL offers the most robust selection of 
    whiskeys in the state, from bourbons you might see at a neighborhood dive, 
    to rare, vintage scotches and esoteric Japanese varieties. Some come with a 
    hefty price tag; it's to each their own to decide whether it's worth the 
    splurge. If you need some sound advice about what to order, you're in luck: 
    The staff here is rigorously trained in both service and knowledge.

    Bible Club Pdx
    Going to Bible Club, in sleepy Sellwood/Moreland, feels like taking a 
    journey back in time. Every single thing in the bar, from the floor to the 
    ceiling, the furniture to the door knobs, the bar equipment to the lighting,
    dates back to the 1930s—at the latest. Most of it is actually from the 19th 
    century—even the tunes predate Prohibition. It's often referred to, both by 
    its owners and local media, as a "museum you can drink in." Another notable 
    feature is the price of the cocktails; unusually for Portland, none cost 
    less than $12, and many hit the $16 mark. Then again, each drink incorporates 
    high-quality ingredients and high-end booze. If you're looking to really 
    splash out, ask about the secret Seven Deadly Sins menu ($30 to $100), 
    where drinks like the Robber Baron will ruin you for any other Old Fashioned.

    Devils Point
    Portland's strip club culture is uniquely progressive, and it's a deeply 
    ingrained part of the city's bar culture as a whole. Devils Point is a 
    perfect example of this, with its incredibly talented dancers and raucous 
    vibes—there's nothing else like it. If you're expecting a cliché strip club 
    crowd, you'll be surprised. Rather than sketchy-looking businessman throwing 
    piles of dollar bills onstage, the crowd here is indistinguishable from any 
    other neighborhood bar, with men, women, groups, and couples all rallying 
    around to enjoy the drinks and entertainment in the progressive, upbeat 
    atmosphere. Grab a domestic tallboy—never a fancy cocktail—and join them.
